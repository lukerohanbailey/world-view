# World View üåç

World View is a collection of JavaScript and WebGL/GLSL techniques used to create an interactive planet with focusable markers using [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/). This goal of this repo is for it to evolve into a more developer friendly tool allowing for easy planetary rendering and data mapping.

## Development
1. Run `npm install`
2. Duplicate `.env.sample` and rename to `.env`
3. Update the `MIX_BS_PROXY` value to the vhost you're using locally
4. Run `npm start` to build and watch files
